      # What types of transaction scenarios are there?
      # 1. If a transaction is already open, use it as a "nested transaction", otherwise, open a new one.
      #    A nested transaction means that "rollback" is the same as "revert" and "commit" is the same as "flush".
      #    For a true
      # 2. If a transaction is already open, raise an error. otherwise, open a new one.
      # 3. Open a new, independent transaction, no matter what.
      # 4. If a transaction is already open, use it, otherwise, open a new one.
      # 5. We are outside of a transaction but have a handle on one. We want to set it as the current transaction.
      #    and do some work in that transaction.
      # Which use cases do we probably need at the moment?
      # 1. If we are running a command calling other commands, we will open transactions when needed but
      #    inherit any already-open transactions. Commands don't commit or flush to the already-open transactions
      #    that they inherit. So this feels like a "use existing" situation or a situation where we don't even
      #    bother calling open_transaction at all.  This is the most important use-case.  It can be helpful to raise
      #    in this situation because it is not expected that there's an existing transaction yet we're opening another.
      # 2. We might have a situation where we are in one transaction but definitely want to open a new one and
      #    commit it ourselves and have its results committed and visible independent of the current transaction.
      #    So this feels like a "open new" situation where we don't want to raise an error if a transaction is
      #    already open.
